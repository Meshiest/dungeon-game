## Go Dungeon Game

Using [go-dungeon](https://github.com/Meshiest/go-dungeon) and [go-gl](https://github.com/go-gl/gl), this is an OpenGL Go Roguelike

It's still very much in development, but right now at least you can walk around and see a generated dungeon in 3d!

To test it out, simply clone the repo, `go get` and `go run game.go`

Controls are as follows:

* WASD to move
* Mouse to look
* Escape to quit

It currently looks like this:
